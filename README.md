# Bubble Sort algorithm with C#
Implementation of [bubble sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) in C#.

This is a console application, just clone or download and them execute in Visual Studio. (I recommended Visual Studio Community Edition).

The code of the implementation is in the *program.cs* file.
